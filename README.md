# VaccineResponse_GWAS
**Background**: The impact of genetics on the heterogeneous immune response and risks of breakthrough infections remains unclear for the different COVID-19 vaccines. Understanding the role of genetic variants on humoral response and subsequent breakthrough outcomes is key to reveal mechanisms underlying vaccine effectiveness. 

**Objective**: To perform four genome wide association studies among vaccinated participants for COVID-19 vaccine antibody response and breakthrough outcomes.
